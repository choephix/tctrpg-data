# Txtrpg-data Branches

### `master`
...

### `poc`
The village of ***Rok***, in which you set out to prove the concept of project Txtrpg.
A contained, roughly presentable demonstration of finished game features, and a testbed for design and narrative ideas.
Be nice to the _innkeeper_, he may be you most valuable link to this unknown world...

### `lorem`
The village of ***Lorem*** is full of exciting placeholders and extreme ordinary situations. 
This is the place for quick and repeated testing of existing game features, in a strictly mechanical sense.
It's not supposed to make sense, rather it provides access to ways for pushing the limits of the ui frame and the gameplay logic.

### `develop`
The village of ***Áppe*** — an often broken pile of locations, items , etc.
Default testbed for current work, content is rapidly added, removed and updated.
Often, after a feature is roughly finished, content created for it may be polished up a bit and moved to Lorem.

### `shitbox`
Absolute shitpile. No one knows where you even are, what does it even mean to be anywhere? 
Don't expect anything to work. Everything is broken by default.
This is the place only for the bravest, to experiment ambitous, albeit utterly vague as ideas.
